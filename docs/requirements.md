# üìà Detailed Specification for an Algo Trading Application

## üß© Design, Architecture, and Feature Requirements

### üîç Overview
An advanced AlgoTrading application should be **modular**, **flexible**, and **responsive** in real time.  
It must support both **back-testing** and **forward-testing** of trading strategies across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges using the **CCXT library** for API integration.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Components

### 1. Configuration Management
- Centralized via a `config.yaml` file.
- Enables toggling exchanges, setting credentials, defining strategy parameters, and managing asset pairs.

### 2. Exchange Integration
- Powered by **CCXT**, supporting exchanges like:
  - `Binance`, `Bybit`, `Bitget`, `Kraken`, `OKX`, `Poloniex`, `WazirX`, `Bitbns`, `DeltaExchange`, and many more.
- A utility script `CCXT_ListofExchange.py` dynamically lists all supported exchanges.

### 3. Back-Testing Module (`backtest.py`)
- Executes user-defined strategies on historical data.
- Provides visual output using **Pandas DataFrames** and **charts (matplotlib/Plotly)**.
- Displays comprehensive KPIs (see below).

### 4. Forward Testing & Real-Time Trading (`main.py`)
- Scans markets live and applies strategies to real-time data.
- Notifies or places orders when trade conditions are met.
- Simulates trades in demo mode or executes them in live mode based on `config.yaml`.

### 5. Configuration Directory
- Stores user API credentials securely.
- Maintains isolation between code and sensitive data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Layer

- `config.yaml` enables:
  - Activating or deactivating exchanges
  - Storing exchange-specific credentials: API Key, Secret, Passphrase, etc.
  - Specifying assets and timeframes for scanning/backtesting
- Supports **modular strategy and asset configuration**
- A secure `config/` directory for sensitive credentials

---

## üîÅ Backtesting Logic (backtest.py)

### How It Works:
- Loads asset data from CSV or CCXT
- Runs strategies across multiple timeframes
- Displays metrics on-screen with visual plots

### üìä Key Metrics:
| Metric                     | Description                            |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Start / End / Duration     | Time range of backtest                 |
| Equity Final / Peak [$]    | Final and peak equity                  |
| Return / CAGR / Volatility | Performance indicators                 |
| Sharpe / Sortino / Calmar  | Risk-adjusted return ratios            |
| Max / Avg Drawdown [%]     | Drawdown statistics                    |
| Trade Count                | Total number of trades                 |
| Win Rate [%]               | Win percentage                         |
| Best / Worst Trade [%]     | Performance extremes                   |
| Avg Trade [%]              | Mean return of trades                  |
| Trade Duration             | Max & Avg durations                    |
| Profit Factor              | Total profits vs. losses               |
| Expectancy [%]             | Average expected return                |

## üì° Forward Testing & Real-Time Scan (main.py)

### Features:
- Continuously scans all selected assets in real-time
- Generates and displays **buy/sell signals** based on strategy
- **In Demo Mode**:
  - Simulates order executions on-screen
  - Displays: Asset | Quantity | Entry Time | P/L | Status
- **In Live Mode** (when activated):
  - Executes trades using exchange API credentials
  - Monitors open trades until closure
  - Logs and reports trade lifecycle data

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Async Execution and Performance

- Uses **Python 3.7+ async features** (`asyncio`, `await`) for concurrent exchange and asset polling
- Greatly improves responsiveness and efficiency of market scanning
- Enables high-frequency, multi-exchange performance

---

## üßæ Exchange Discovery & Selection

- `CCXT_ListofExchange.py`: Utility to list all supported exchanges from CCXT
- Automatically populates valid options into `config.yaml`
- Simplifies onboarding and configuration

---

## üîê Security and Best Practices

- API credentials stored in `config/` directory (outside of main code)
- Follow best practices for:
  - Encryption
  - Access controls
  - Log rotation and handling sensitive data

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Workflow

### Backtesting (`backtest.py`)
- Uses data from selected exchange (via CCXT) or input CSV
- Applies strategy
- Displays visual results + KPIs:
  - **Net Profit**, **Profit Factor**, **Max Drawdown**, **Avg Trade**, **Total Trades**, etc.

### Forward Testing / Live Scanning (`main.py`)
- Reads assets and exchanges from `config.yaml`
- Scans market in real-time
- Detects strategy triggers (buy/sell)
- **Demo Mode**: Simulates trades  
- **Live Mode**: Executes actual trades on exchange
- Tracks and logs each trade end-to-end

---

## üí° Next Steps

- ‚úÖ Split logic clearly between:
  - `backtest.py` ‚Üí for historical strategy testing
  - `main.py` ‚Üí for live/daily trading and signal detection
- ‚úÖ Create `config.yaml` and input CSV structure
- ‚úÖ Ensure async CCXT handling across exchange APIs
- ‚úÖ Visualize results with Pandas + Plotly/Matplotlib

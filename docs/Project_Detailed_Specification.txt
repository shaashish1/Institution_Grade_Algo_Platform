Detailed Specification for an Algo Trading Application
Design, Architecture, and Feature Requirements
Overview
An advanced AlgoTrading application should be architected with modularity, flexibility, and real-time 
responsiveness. The system will support both back-testing and forward-testing of trading strategies across 
multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, utilizing the CCXT library for API integration.
Architectural Components
*	Configuration Management: Centralized configuration via a config.yaml file, allowing users to specify 
which exchanges are enabled, provide credentials, and set other strategy and asset parameters.
*	Exchange Integration: Use the CCXT library to connect to a wide range of cryptocurrency exchanges 
(e.g., ['ace', 'alpaca', 'ascendex', 'bequant', 'bigone', 'binance', 'binancecoinm', 'binanceus', 'binanceusdm', 
'bit2c', 'bitbank', 'bitbay', 'bitbns', 'bitcoincom', 'bitfinex', 'bitfinex2', 'bitflyer', 'bitforex', 'bitget', 'bithumb', 
'bitmart', 'bitmex', 'bitopro', 'bitpanda', 'bitrue', 'bitso', 'bitstamp', 'bitstamp1', 'bittrex', 'bitvavo', 'bkex', 
'bl3p', 'blockchaincom', 'btcalpha', 'btcbox', 'btcex', 'btcmarkets', 'btctradeua', 'btcturk', 'buda', 'bybit', 
'cex', 'coinbase', 'coinbaseprime', 'coinbasepro', 'coincheck', 'coinex', 'coinfalcon', 'coinmate', 'coinone', 
'coinsph', 'coinspot', 'cryptocom', 'currencycom', 'delta', 'deribit', 'digifinex', 'exmo', 'flowbtc', 'fmfwio', 
'gate', 'gateio', 'gemini', 'hitbtc', 'hitbtc3', 'hollaex', 'huobi', 'huobijp', 'huobipro', 'idex', 
'independentreserve', 'indodax', 'itbit', 'kraken', 'krakenfutures', 'kucoin', 'kucoinfutures', 'kuna', 'latoken', 
'lbank', 'lbank2', 'luno', 'lykke', 'mercado', 'mexc', 'mexc3', 'ndax', 'novadax', 'oceanex', 'okcoin', 'okex', 
'okex5', 'okx', 'paymium', 'phemex', 'poloniex', 'poloniexfutures', 'probit', 'ripio', 'stex', 'tidex', 'timex', 
'tokocrypto', 'upbit', 'wavesexchange', 'wazirx', 'whitebit', 'woo', 'yobit', 'zaif', 'zb', 'zonda']).
*	Back-Testing Module: Encapsulated in backtest.py, this module allows users to test their trading 
strategies against historical data, analyzing performance metrics and visualizing results.
*	Forward-Testing & Real-Time Trading Module: Handled by main.py, this component scans markets in 
real time, generates signals based on strategy conditions, and tracks the live performance of executed 
trades. Optionally, live orders can be placed if exchange credentials are configured and the flag is Active 
in config.yaml (Live/Demo)
*	Exchange Listing Utility: The ‘CCXT_ListofExchange.py’ utility provides a dynamic list of all exchanges 
supported by CCXT, facilitating easy configuration and onboarding.
*	Configuration Directory: A secure, structured directory where users can input and manage their 
exchange API credentials and other sensitive settings. 
Configuration Layer
*	The config.yaml file will allow users to toggle which exchanges are active. Each exchange configuration 
should support API key, secret, and any relevant credentials or parameters (such as rate limits, trading 
pairs, etc.).
*	Support for a flag system to easily activate/deactivate exchanges as per user requirements.
*	Configuration directory securely manages sensitive credentials separately from code, enabling both local 
and production deployments.
Back-Testing Logic (backtest.py)
When backtest.py is run, the application fetches historical price data for the defined assets and executes the 
chosen trading strategy on this data. Include visual charts on screen to show backtest results. 
*	Performance metrics displayed will include:
1.	Start
2.	End
3.	Duration
4.	Exposure Time [%]
5.	Equity Final [$]
6.	Equity Peak [$]
7.	Return [%]
8.	Buy & Hold Return [%]
9.	Return (Ann.) [%]
10.	Volatility (Ann.) [%]
11.	CAGR [%]
12.	Sharpe Ratio
13.	Sortino Ratio
14.	Calmar Ratio
15.	Alpha [%]
16.	Beta
17.	Max. Drawdown [%]
18.	Avg. Drawdown [%]
19.	Max. Drawdown Duration
20.	Avg. Drawdown Duration
21.	# Trades
22.	Win Rate [%]
23.	Best Trade [%]
24.	Worst Trade [%]
25.	Avg. Trade [%]
26.	Max. Trade Duration
27.	Avg. Trade Duration
28.	Profit Factor
29.	Expectancy [%]
Refer https://github.com/kernc/backtesting.py this provides all output vales for backtest. 
Results and KPIs are shown using Pandas DataFrames for tabular representation and rich visualization via charts 
(e.g., matplotlib, Plotly).
Forward-Testing (DEMO) and Real-Time Scanning (Live_trade_main.py)
*	Upon execution, main.py the script should continuously monitors selected all input assets on active 
exchanges in real time.
*	When a strategy condition is met (e.g., buy or sell signal), the application notifies the user, and if live 
trading is enabled, places the order through the relevant exchange API. If exchange in not active and in 
demo mode, it should display the trades on screen and like order executed just like in exchange, Assets | 
Quantity | Amount| Time Trade entered| Profit/Loss| Trade active or closed|
*	The application tracks each trade from entry to exit, enabling comprehensive forward-testing and live 
monitoring.
*	Trade lifecycle management ensures that each open trade is monitored until closure, with performance 
information logged for review.
Asynchronous Execution and Performance
*	The application leverages the asynchronous mode supported by CCXT. With asyncio and async/await on 
Python 3.7.0+, multiple exchange APIs and asset data can be queried concurrently, maximizing 
performance and reducing latency.
*	This architecture ensures the system remains responsive even with high-frequency scans and multiple 
parallel tasks.
Exchange Directory and Listing
*	CCXT_ListofExchange.py enables discovery of all currently supported exchanges, simplifying user 
selection and configuration in config.yaml.
Security and Best Practices
*	API credentials are stored securely outside core codebase, with best practices for encryption and access 
control.
*	Logs and sensitive data are managed and rotated according to compliance standards.
Summary
A robust AlgoTrading application should provide seamless integration with major exchanges, support flexible 
configuration, enable rigorous back- and forward-testing of strategies, and operate efficiently using 
asynchronous programming paradigms. By splitting logic into clear modules and providing rich analytics, users 
can optimize and deploy trading strategies with confidence.
I want to back-test the strategy, and also be able to do forward test to know how the strategy is performing in 
realtime. We need config.yaml file to be used for configuring various exchanges available from CCXT like Kraken, 
Binance, BYbit, Bitget, CEX.io, Dribit, OKK, DeltaExchange,  WazirX, BITBNS, OKK, Poloniex and all available and 
give a flag which exchange is active. when I run main.py it is scanning in real-time and also doing back test, is my 
understanding correct? if yes, can we split the logic to backtest.py , if this file is run, it will do a backtest using the 
defined assets and strategy and display results in screen using panda data frames and charts. provide profit 
percentage, profit factor, max drawdown, Average trade and total trades, Net Profit, these KPI as part of backtest 
results. when we run main.py it should run raltime scan and provide message when the strategy condition meets 
for buy or sell. Once the order is picked as buy or sell then track that assets until trade is closed. This will provide 
me to track forward testy and if I do configuration to exchange, then live orders can also be placed.
The CCXT library supports The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode with asyncio and async/await in 
Python 3.7.0+ and let utilize this feature in our application. 
I have created one file CCXT_ListofExchange.py which can list all the supported exchanges from CCXT. Use this to 
create configuration file for user to configure active exchange. 
We can create a configuration directory to enter exchange credentials.

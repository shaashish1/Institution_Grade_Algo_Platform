### **🗑️ AI Signals, Auto Execution, Risk Control Boxes**
Successfully removed the three main feature cards from the doodle showcase:

- ❌ **AI Signals** - "Smart algorithms that actually make sense. No more crypto jargon!"
- ❌ **Auto Execution** - "Set it and forget it! Our AlgoBot handles the heavy lifting."  
- ❌ **Risk Control** - "Sleep peacefully knowing your portfolio is protected."

## **📁 Files Modified**

```

## **🎯 What Remains on Main Page**

### **✅ Kept Components**
- **Hero Section**: "Trading that Feels Human 🤖💙" header
- **Community Section**: Learn & Grow, Share & Connect, Celebrate Success  
- **Pricing Section**: Starter, Pro, Whale plans
- **AlgoBot Mascot**: Animated character elements
- **Background Elements**: Doodle decorations and animations

### **✅ Pricing Features Preserved**
The pricing plans still reference some features like "Basic AI Signals" and "Advanced AI Signals" but these are:
- **Different context**: Part of plan features, not standalone boxes

- **Not overlays**: Integrated into pricing cards

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring and reorganizing the AlgoProject AI-driven smart trading platform. The current codebase has grown to over 12,754 Python files, indicating poor organization, redundancy, and potential auto-generated files. The goal is to create a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture that supports both crypto and stock trading with comprehensive backtesting, demo trading, and live trading capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Codebase Structure Reorganization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized codebase structure, so that I can easily navigate, maintain, and extend the trading platform.

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have a maximum of 200 core Python files (excluding generated outputs)
2. WHEN organizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL follow the specified directory structure with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN implementing modules THEN the system SHALL use dynamic imports and class-based strategy handling instead of per-file strategies
4. WHEN structuring directories THEN the system SHALL separate crypto and stocks functionality into dedicated modules
5. IF a file serves multiple purposes THEN the system SHALL be refactored into single-responsibility modules

### Requirement 2: User Authentication and Onboarding

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in via Google OAuth and set up my trading preferences, so that I can personalize my trading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL provide Google OAuth login functionality
2. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect to the asset setup dashboard
3. WHEN setting up assets THEN the system SHALL display available exchanges supported by CCXT
4. WHEN selecting an exchange THEN the system SHALL show available asset classes (Spot, Futures, Options)
5. WHEN choosing trading pairs THEN the system SHALL display all available pairs for the selected exchange and asset class
6. WHEN saving preferences THEN the system SHALL store user selections in their profile for future use

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Backtesting System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to run comprehensive backtests on multiple strategies and assets, so that I can identify the best performing combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running backtests THEN the system SHALL support multiple strategies across multiple assets simultaneously
2. WHEN selecting timeframes THEN the system SHALL display available historical data bars and their count
3. WHEN backtesting completes THEN the system SHALL calculate and display 29+ KPIs including Profit Factor, Sharpe Ratio, Win Rate
4. WHEN comparing results THEN the system SHALL rank strategies using Profit Factor DESC, then Sharpe Ratio DESC
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show star ratings (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ to ❌) based on performance thresholds
6. WHEN generating outputs THEN the system SHALL save trade logs, KPI summaries, and equity curve charts
7. WHEN identifying top performers THEN the system SHALL highlight the best strategy-asset-timeframe combination with deployment option

### Requirement 4: Demo Trading Simulation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to simulate live trading with my best backtest configurations, so that I can validate strategies before risking real money.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting demo trading THEN the system SHALL use the selected strategy-asset-timeframe combination from backtesting
2. WHEN simulating trades THEN the system SHALL use live market data for realistic execution
3. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL display real-time PnL, equity, trades, and risk metrics
4. WHEN monitoring risk THEN the system SHALL send alerts if strategy breaks predefined thresholds
5. WHEN running demo trades THEN the system SHALL maintain the same KPI calculations as backtesting

### Requirement 5: Live Trading Execution

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to execute live trades using validated strategies, so that I can automate my trading with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up live trading THEN the system SHALL securely handle API key input and storage
2. WHEN connecting to exchanges THEN the system SHALL test and validate API connections before trading
3. WHEN executing live trades THEN the system SHALL use the same strategy logic validated in demo trading
4. WHEN monitoring live trading THEN the system SHALL display order book, positions, and real-time performance
5. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL provide the same 29+ KPIs as backtesting and demo trading
6. WHEN managing risk THEN the system SHALL implement stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing controls

### Requirement 6: Dynamic Strategy Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage trading strategies dynamically through configuration, so that I can add new strategies without code deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding strategies THEN the system SHALL support class-based strategy definitions
2. WHEN configuring strategies THEN the system SHALL use YAML/JSON configuration files
3. WHEN loading strategies THEN the system SHALL use dynamic imports instead of hardcoded file references
4. WHEN validating strategies THEN the system SHALL ensure all strategies implement required interfaces
5. WHEN managing strategy parameters THEN the system SHALL support runtime parameter modification

### Requirement 7: Data Management and Processing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient data management for historical and live market data, so that the platform can scale with user demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching historical data THEN the system SHALL cache data efficiently to minimize API calls
2. WHEN processing live data THEN the system SHALL handle real-time data streams without blocking
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL organize data by exchange, asset class, and timeframe
4. WHEN managing data retention THEN the system SHALL implement configurable data cleanup policies
5. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL provide unified interfaces for both crypto and stock data

### Requirement 8: Reporting and Visualization

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive reports and visualizations of my trading performance, so that I can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create equity curves, drawdown charts, and performance tables
2. WHEN comparing strategies THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side performance comparisons
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support CSV, JSON, and PDF export formats
4. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL use interactive charts with zoom and filter capabilities
5. WHEN saving reports THEN the system SHALL organize outputs by date, strategy, and asset

### Requirement 9: API and Integration Layer

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want well-defined APIs for all platform functionality, so that I can build responsive user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization
3. WHEN returning data THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON response formats
4. WHEN managing sessions THEN the system SHALL support secure session management
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and status codes

### Requirement 10: Configuration and Environment Management

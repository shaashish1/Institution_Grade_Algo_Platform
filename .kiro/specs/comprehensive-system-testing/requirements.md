# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves comprehensive testing and fixing of all files in the AlgoProject trading system. The system is a multi-asset trading platform supporting both cryptocurrency and stock trading with advanced backtesting, live trading, and portfolio management capabilities. The testing will validate all modules, scripts, configurations, and integrations to ensure the entire system functions correctly and reliably.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all Python files to be syntactically correct and importable, so that the trading platform operates without import errors or syntax failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Python file is imported THEN the system SHALL successfully load without syntax errors
2. WHEN module dependencies are checked THEN all required packages SHALL be available and properly installed
3. WHEN circular imports are tested THEN the system SHALL not have any circular dependency issues
4. IF a Python file has syntax errors THEN the system SHALL automatically fix common syntax issues
5. WHEN __init__.py files are validated THEN they SHALL properly expose module interfaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want all trading scripts to execute successfully, so that I can run backtests, live trading, and analysis without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN crypto trading scripts are executed THEN they SHALL run without runtime errors
2. WHEN stock trading scripts are executed THEN they SHALL run without runtime errors  
3. WHEN strategy scripts are executed THEN they SHALL properly calculate signals and metrics
4. IF a script fails during execution THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and attempt automatic fixes
5. WHEN launcher scripts are executed THEN they SHALL properly initialize and display menus

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all configuration files to be valid and properly formatted, so that the system can load settings and credentials correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YAML configuration files are parsed THEN they SHALL be valid YAML format
2. WHEN CSV asset files are loaded THEN they SHALL have proper headers and data format
3. WHEN JSON configuration files are processed THEN they SHALL be valid JSON format
4. IF configuration files have format errors THEN the system SHALL fix common formatting issues
5. WHEN configuration schemas are validated THEN they SHALL match expected structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all modules, so that I can verify system functionality and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL cover all critical functions and methods
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN they SHALL validate module interactions
3. WHEN API tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify external service integrations
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure reports and suggested fixes
5. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL meet minimum coverage thresholds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want all file dependencies and imports to be resolved correctly, so that the system has no missing dependencies or broken references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency analysis is performed THEN all imports SHALL resolve to existing modules
2. WHEN external package dependencies are checked THEN all required packages SHALL be installed
3. WHEN file references are validated THEN all file paths SHALL exist and be accessible
4. IF dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide installation instructions or automatic fixes
5. WHEN version compatibility is checked THEN all packages SHALL be compatible versions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want automated fixing of common issues, so that the system can self-heal and maintain operational status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common syntax errors are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically fix them
2. WHEN missing imports are identified THEN the system SHALL add appropriate import statements
3. WHEN formatting issues are found THEN the system SHALL apply consistent code formatting
4. IF configuration errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide corrected configuration examples
5. WHEN file permissions are incorrect THEN the system SHALL suggest or apply proper permissions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive reporting of all test results and fixes, so that I can track system health and maintenance activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed test report
2. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL log all changes made
3. WHEN issues are identified THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and type
4. IF critical issues are found THEN the system SHALL highlight them in the report
5. WHEN testing history is reviewed THEN the system SHALL maintain historical test results
